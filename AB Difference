Vijay is taking his baby steps into the world of programming.
The very first program he's tasked to write is as follows: "Given two integers A and B, print A+B."
Unfortunately, Vijay makes a typo: his program outputs A×B instead of A+B.
Given the values of A and B, can you help Vijay find the absolute difference between the correct answer and the value his program prints?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int A, B;
    scanf("%d %d", &A, &B);
    printf("%d", abs((A * B) - (A + B)));
    return 0;
}
